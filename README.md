# Getting Started with Create Rescript-React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Later rescript library was installed on this existing project.
Tailwind CSS support added

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run re:start`

Runs the Rescript Compiler

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`

Runs the tailwind CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and builds your CSS.
